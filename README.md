# LoadBalancingAlgorithms
Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed.

By evenly spreading the workload, load balancing aims to prevent overload on a single server, enhance performance by reducing response times and improve availability by rerouting traffic in case of server failures. There are several algorithms to achieve load balancing, each with its pros and cons.In this we will dive into the most commonly used load balancing algorithms, how they work, when to use them, their benefits/drawbacks and how to implement them in code.

## Algorithm 1: Round Robin

When to Use:
- When all servers have similar processing capabilities and are equally capable of handling requests.
- When simplicity and even distribution of load is more critical.

Benefits:
- Simple to implement and understand.
- Ensures even distribution of traffic.

Drawbacks:
- Does not consider server load or response time.
- Can lead to inefficiencies if servers have different processing capabilities.

## Implementation:
